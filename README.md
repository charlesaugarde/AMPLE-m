# AMPLE.m
AMPLE - A Material Point Learning Environment

AMPLE.m is a quasi-static implicit implementation of the material point method in MATLAB.  
More information about AMPLE.m can be obtained from the project webapges:

AMPLE is an elasto-plastic large deformation material point code with a regular quadrilateral background mesh 
(the main code is ample.m).   The continuum framework is based on an updated Lagrangian formation and two 
different constitutive models are included: linear elasticity and a linear elastic-perfectly plastic model 
with a von Mises yield surface.  
 
It is suggested that users start by looking at the “index.html” file within the “documentation” folder.  
The html files were complied with M2HTML (https://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/) and they should 
provide  an overview of the code and how it all fits together.  The scripts should also be compatible with 
MATLAB’s “help” function.

Version history:

AMPLE     - original AMPLE release

AMPLE_1.1 - version 1.1, released August 2020 - focused on runtime improvement

July 2026:
* added 3D elastic column collapse creating a new setup file called `setupGrid_column3D.m`
* for consistency renamed the 2D elasric column collapse to `setupGrid_column2D.m`
* created `formCoord3D.m` for the 3D example
* in testing the 3D problem came across convergence issues and generation of stresses in the two horizontal directions. Tracked this down to the generation of very small impaginary parts to `duvw`, caused by slight unsymmetry in `epsEN` and `BeT` not seen with the 2D version. Dealt with this by adding lines to ensure symmetry e.g. `epsEn = 0.5*(epsEn + epsEn');` in `detMPs.m`.
* to discuss with WMC - addition/amendment of commenting in the code, dates at the top etc.
